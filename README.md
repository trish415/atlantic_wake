Description
Atlantic Wake is a 2D fishing game! Catch as many fish as possible while avoiding the junk- but catch three pieces of junk and it’s game over! It’s a quick and easy game to play- try to beat your high score while waiting in line for the bus, riding the subway, bored in class… the possibilities are endless.

Instructions 
Tap beneath the hook to place it. Catch the fish while avoiding the junk that floats by. The game ends when you catch three pieces of junk. Slow fish are worth 3 points, regular fish are worth 5 points and fast fish are worth 10 points! Catching junk causes you to lose 5 points. contains the necessary files for Atlantic Wake.

How to Run
You can download the unity source code below to play the game on a computer. However, his game is designed to be played on mobile so we suggest using Unity Remote 4 to be able to play the game on an iPhone.

The game should be initialized with the 'Start.unity' scene. From there the buttons on that scene allows you to navigate to the 'Rules.unity' and 'Fishing.unity' scenes.
